About the Blog
------
This blog is mainly based on Corey Schafer's flask tutorial on Youtube.
After completing the tutorial, I have made some custom changes to the web app, such as a category model,
a search bar and a left sidebar.

Since I don't know much about css, the current looking of the blog is kind of messy, I will change it
after I learn more about the front-end.
